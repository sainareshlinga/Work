Write your one year experience in KL University 

My one year experience in KL University was great as my first year in a graduate college. I had high hopes though werent as i thought , the experience was special in its own category. Not much changed from my habituated school days.
 The days where i used to tuck my shirt, though there werent fines those days.As a new student, I was eager to explore all the opportunities that college had to offer. 
From joining clubs and societies to participating in events and activities, there was never a dull moment.
n addition to clubs and societies, there were also plenty of events and activities happening on campus. From guest lectures and workshops to cultural festivals and sports competitions, there was always something going on. These events not only provided a welcome break from my studies but also gave me the chance to learn new things.
 The classes were though great in there own way with lectureres giving there best. I scored good not the best though.
I also took advantage of online resources and upskilled on professional courses. There were so many courses available on topics ranging from data analysis and project management to creative writing and graphic design.
Made a lot of friends some worth staying , some worth nothing.These experiences not only helped me gain valuable skills but also made me more confident in my abilities.
my freshers year has been a time of growth and discovery. I’ve made new friends, gained new experiences, and learned so much about myself. I’m excited to see what the rest of my college journey has in store for me.
